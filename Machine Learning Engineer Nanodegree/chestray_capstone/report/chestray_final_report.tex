    \section{Definition}
    \subsection{Project Overview}
    In medical industry chest x-ray is the most commonly performed diagnostic x-ray examination. It produces images of the heart, lungs, airways, blood vessels and the bones of the spine and chest. An x-ray(radiograph) is a non-invasive medical way for physicians to diagnose and treat medical conditions. Performing such an x-ray involves exposing the the chest to a small dose of ionizing radiation to produce the pictures of the body. X-rays are the most frequently used form of medical imaging. 
    
    The chest x-ray is commonly the first imaging test used to help diagnose symptoms such as chest pain, breathing difficulties, bad or consistent cough etc. Physicians will use these imaging to diagnose or monitor treatments for conditions such as pneumonia, heart problems, lung cancer, fluid or air collection in lungs etc. Although this isn't necessarily a conclusive diagnosis for all kind of diseases it is the first tool of diagnosing any possible illnesses for the above said symptoms.\cite{xray-details} 

    This project will showcase a neural network which will provide the predictions on chest X-ray images with some certainty better than random guessing. 

    \subsection{Problem Statement}
    Chest X-ray exams are one of the most frequent and cost-effective medical imaging examinations available. However, clinical diagnosis of a chest X-ray can be challenging and sometimes more difficult than diagnosis via chest CT.\cite{nih-kaggle}
    
    Reading and diagnosing chest x-ray images may be a relatively simple task for radiologists but, in fact, it is a complex reasoning problem which often requires careful observation and knowledge of anatomical principles, physiology and pathology. Such factors increase the difficulty of developing a consistent and automated technique for reading chest X-ray images while simultaneously considering all common thoracic diseases.\cite{nih-gov-xray-release}

    There is a need to develop an automated technique that could analyze a given chest x-ray and which could predict the possible common thoracic diseases with some certainty. Also, it should aid radiologists or physicians by highlighting the suspected common areas of disease in order to pay close attention to certain areas of a chest x-ray, so as to not misdiagnose these diseases. This automated technique could benefit patients in developing countries who do not have access to the radiologists to read these x-rays.

    The general approach or strategy on getting the solution will be as below.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The dataset for chest xrays with disease labels will be imported and explored for feature sets. This would involve doing data exploration as well as data preprocessing to build formatted feature set for trainig the data.
        \item A naive training model will be implemented to see how well we can classify or predict the disease labels. 
        \item Subsequently we will develop a well trained model with fine tuning the parameters. Further more any kind of possible refinements will be applied with existing art to further improve the disease predictions on the xray images.
        \item The developed solution will be measured for success with below metrics.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Metrics}
    One such success metric of such a system would be the ability to predict disease outcome with some certainty than say, random prediction. The implication of these predictions is that if we predict negative result for a person with disease it will be harmful, thus we want to be cautious and be \textit{sensitive} for our predictions. Since we have multilabel classification task we will measure this performance by using Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) with Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics. The ROC curve is a graphical plot which illustrates the performance of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. It is created by plotting the fraction of true positives out of all the positives(TPR = True Positive Rate) vs the fraction of false positives out of the negatives (FPR = false positive rate) at various threshold settings. TPR is also known as sensitivity and FPR is one minus the specificity or true negative rate.\cite{roc-metric}\cite{auc}

    \begin{equation}
        FPR = \frac{FP}{FP + TN}, TPR = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
            AUC = \int_{x=0}^{1} TPR(FPR^{-1}(x))dx
    \end{equation}

    \section{Analysis}
    \subsection{Data Exploration and Visualization}
    National Institutes of Health has released over 112,000 chest X-ray images with the labeled data, 15 labels: 14 diseases, 1 no findings.\cite{nih-gov-xray-release} we will be using this data to build a convolutional neural network for disease prediction from a chest X-ray image. In order to build the neural network the following data analysis was executed on the above said data.

    \begin{figure}
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./images/labels_distribution.jpg}
        \caption{Disease label distribution.}
        \label{fig:labels-distribution}
    \end{figure}
    
    The figure \ref{fig:labels-distribution} shows the distribution of the 112000 X-ray images. It can be seen that our data is highly biased with over 60,000 of chest x-ray images labeled with \textit{No Finding}, and over fifty percent of the images tagged with three diseases \textit{Infiltration, Effusion, Atelectasis}. The rest of the 11 diseases are labeled with the remaining fifty percent of the images. This is an expected data given the nature of healthcare industry where often procedures are performed as a preventative or diagnosing step. And the possiblity of multiple pathologies of similar nature. Given this analysis it is a given that we will need to do some preprocessing to balance the data.

    The figure \ref{fig:labels-vs-gender} shows the disease labels vs gender distribution. The data is more or less simlarly distributed and given the pathologies there is no co-relation between the disease labels and the gender. Thus, it is fine to ignore the gender feature for our analysis.

    \begin{figure}
      \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./images/labels_vs_gender.jpg}
      \caption{Disease labels vs Gender distribution.}
      \label{fig:labels-vs-gender}
    \end{figure}

    The figure \ref{fig:age-vs-gender} shows the gender distribution over the age period. This figure shows that the provided data distribution ranges for all genders for all age periods. This reflects the above conclusion that there is no need for the gender feature to be considered for the analysis.

    \begin{figure}
      \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./images/age_gender_distribution.jpg}
      \caption{Age vs Gender distribution}
      \label{fig:age-vs-gender}
    \end{figure}

    The figure \ref{fig:disease-age-vs-gender} shows the each category of disease labels distribution over gender and age. The data seems to show that all the disease labels are independent of age or gender. This helps us to decide that age feature is not a factor for contribution to the diseases and can be safely ignored for our analysis.

    \begin{figure}
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./images/disease_age_gender_distribution.jpg}
        \caption{Disease vs Age vs Gender distribution}
        \label{fig:disease-age-vs-gender}
    \end{figure}

    The figure \ref{fig:multiple-diseases} shows the classification of diseases by multiple pathologies present in the dataset. It can be seen that most of the data for the labeled data shows some xrays with single disease but a lot more with multiple pathologies. It means our CNN model needs to be able to predict multiple diseases and these disesases are not exclusive to each other.

    \begin{figure}
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./images/multiple_disease_distribution.jpg}
        \caption{Multiple pathologies in the dataset}
        \label{fig:multiple-diseases}
    \end{figure}

    \section{Algorithms and Techniques}
    Essentially the problem statement boils down to recognizing a pattern in image for each of the labeled diseases. This in fact is a image classification problem. The general technique to approach such a problem is developing a Deep Neural Network model which would learn the pattern of the diseases in the provided images. The deep neural network has thousands of nodes and training parameters which will take forever to train the model, the improvement is done with the localization of pixels in the image by using Convolutional approach based on pooling of filters. The figure \ref{fig:cnn-process} shows the approach the CNN takes in achieving this task.
    \begin{figure}
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./images/convolutional-neural-net-process-3.png}
        \caption{CNN Process}
        \label{fig:cnn-process}
    \end{figure}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The real input image that is scanned for features. The filter that passes over it is the light rectangle.
        \item The Activation maps are arranged in a stack on the top of one another, one for each filter you use. The larger rectangle is 1 patch to be downsampled.
        \item The activation maps condensed via downsampling.
        \item A new group of activation maps generated by passing the filters over the stack that is downsampled first.
        \item The second downsampling â€“ which condenses the second group of activation maps.
        \item A fully connected layer that designates output with 1 label per node.
    \end{itemize}
    The convolutional layer is generated and trained as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item At first, the image, xray, is broken down into a series of overlapping, lets say, 2*2 pixel tiles.
        \item After that, we run each of these tiles via a simple, single-layer neural network by keeping the weights unaltered. This will change the collection of tiles into an array. As we kept each of the images small(2*2 in this case), the neural network needed to process them stays manageable and small.
        \item Then, the output values will be taken and arranged in an array that numerically represents each areaâ€™s content in the iamge, with the axes representing color, width and height channels. So, for each tile, we would have a 2*2*3 representation in this case.
        \item The next step is the pooling layer. It takes these 3 or 4 dimensional arrays and applies a downsampling function together with spatial dimensions. The result is a pooled array that contains only the image portions that are important while discarding the rest, which minimizes the computations that are needed to be done while also avoiding the overfitting problem.
        \item The downsampled array is taken and utilized as the regular fully connected neural networkâ€™s input. Since the inputâ€™s size has been reduced dramatically using pooling and convolution, we must now have something that a normal network will be able to handle while still preserving the most significant portions of data. The final stepâ€™s output will represent how confident the system is that we have an image with a certain disease that we are trying to predict.
    \end{itemize}
    The convolution, pooling and downsampling is the most common way to generate and train a CNN network for huge data sizes. The other common technique used for training a CNN is usage of transfer learning from a pretrained models to new prediction models. These pretrained models can be loaded with their pre-trained model and retrained if required for our dataset. The retraining could involve freezing certain layers during training purpose to effectively explore the patterns in the images.

    \section{Mehtodology}
    \subsection{Data Preprocessing}
    As per the data analysis done in the above section, we get rid of all the features other than the image names and indexes. This is done as part of our \textit{Preprocessing} step.\cite{github-proj}. Following preprocessing is performed on this data:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Data is loaded from \textit{Data-Entry-2017.csv}, the unnecessary features like \textit{Age, Gender, Original Image width, height, Bounding Box x, y etc.} are deleted. 
        \item Loads all image paths from data folder.
        \item Extract the disease labels and get rid of the label with low count of data, as seen from \ref{fig:labels-distribution} the label \textit{Hernia} has only 227 images which is insufficient to meaningfully predict with the huge bias in remaining data, hence get rid of this prediction label altogether. Thus, the scope of the prediction is narrowed down to the 13 disease labels. 
        \item The dataset is sampled by weight and reduced down to 50000 images, since anything above it is too much data to be meaningfully processed on local machine. The figure \ref{fig:sampled-disease} shows the sampled images by weight, thus still keeping the possible relation with multiple pathologies in the data.
        \item The data is then split into 40000 images for \textit{training}, 6000 images for \textit{validation} and 4000 images for \textit{testing} phases.
        \item The data is co-related with the disease prediction vector with truth values for the disease labels.
    \end{itemize}

        \caption{Sampled by weights}
        \label{fig:sampled-disease}
    \end{figure}

    The text below shows the output from the "pre-processing" stage when loading the data.

    Once the data has been preprocessed we can see the sampled images from the dataset in the figure \ref{fig:sampled-xrays}

    \subsection{Benchmark - Base model}
    
    As the first step towards building a CNN the first step was to build a Dense MLP with 8 layers. This is our benchmark base model since it is simple to construct and train such a model. Upon analyzing this model we can see that it truly behaves like a random classifier with very low scores on predicting any diseases.

    The text below gives an idea on the layers shape and outputs.

    \fbox{\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
        =================================================================\\ 
        Layer (type)                 Output Shape              Param \# \\

        =================================================================\\ 
        dropout\_2 (Dropout)          (None, 128, 128, 32)      0 \\ 
        =================================================================\\ 
        dense\_3 (Dense)              (None, 128, 128, 32)      1056 \\ 
        =================================================================\\

        Non-trainable params: 0\\ 
        =================================================================\\ 
    \end{minipage}}

    The above said model was trained on 10 epochs to get the weights. The best weights were stored using \textit{Keras.Model.Checkpoint} and further loaded for analysis. 

    The figure \ref{fig:base-mlp-roc} shows that the ROC curve is a linear line, thereby giving us an AUC of 0.5 across the board on all the 13 prediction labels. It means that this model is truly random and a terrible classifier.

    \begin{figure}
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./images/base_mlp_roc_auc.jpg}
        \caption{Base MLP ROC AUC}
        \label{fig:base-mlp-roc}
    \end{figure}

    Just to double check we can view the sample predictions on the images below in \ref{fig:base-mlp-pred-samples}, which shows that this base model is essentially predicting only one disease \textit{Mass} for every kind of X-Ray.

        \caption{Base MLP Samples with Actual diagnosis vs Predicted Diagnosis}
        \label{fig:base-mlp-pred-samples}
    \end{figure}

    Note: The \textit{base-mlp-neural-net.py} hosts the source code for training this model in the project.\cite{github-proj}

    \subsection{Convolutional Neural Network - Implementation and Troubles}
    With the benchmark model underway, I started implementation of a convolutional neural network for training the dataset on disease predictions. This involved adding different layers and doing some trial and errors. The main problem faced during this phase was getting the model to train on the GPU with tensor flow. The experiments were carried out on Azure Virtual Machine with Nvidia Tesla M60 Graphics card with a memory of 7.5GB, however, while training I was consistently getting "Resource exhausted: OOM error". This meant that the graphics card was running out of memory when building the models. This involved reducing the batch size of the training generators. However, the issue was persistent. After reading about OOM error messages, stack overflow topics, trial and errors it seemed like the size of X-Ray images was the issue. These x-ray images were loaded into the memory on its full size of 1024*1024 pixels. This basically generated a huge datasize for training the designed CNN. On the order of 128Million trainable parameters. After various experiments, it was seen that reducing the image size to 128*128 pixels allowed sufficient memory for the model to be trained on the GPU. 

    \subsubsection{The CNN model and Analysis}
    After the above issues were resolved, and running different trial and errors with varying epoch values ranging from 2 to 100, and tuning with different optimizers following 14 layer CNN model was the best possible outcome of these experiments.

    \end{minipage}}

    Note: The source code for this training model can be found in \textit{chestr-cnn-model.py}\cite{github-proj}

    \subsubsection{Transfer Learning - InceptionV3}  
    As can be seen from the above model experiments it seemed like the model was stuck in local minima and couldn't make any more improvements with varying epoch values. Thus I decided to apply "Transfer Learning" technique to my model. I used InceptionV3 pre-trained model with "ImageNet" weights. InceptionV3 is an award winning model trained on ImageNet database for classifying images. Given that we have a high volume of data and the image classes are fairly different between "ImageNet" and Chest X-Ray, I decided to apply the "Transfer learning" principles, i.e. train the whole model with freezing and unfreezing pre-trained models along with my top layer. 

    However, these experiments resulted in failures. The model failed to make any kind of improvements, in fact it kept on miscategorizing data. Another challenge was that the pretrained models require the input data(images) are provided with three channels i.e. RGB. The original processing for the data was done with single channel i.e. 'Grayscale' category, since X-rays are always in a grayscale category. This required the data fixing and read the images as RGB instead of grayscale. The online forums indicated that this would work fine, however the model failed to perform any better than the previously developed CNN model.

    Note: This model's source code is hosted in \textit{chestr-inceptionv3-cnn.py}.

    \subsubsection{Transfer Learning - VGG19}  
    Upon further failures to get desired results, I started experimenting with "Transfer learning" with VGG19 pre-trained models and with "ImageNet" weights. As an experiment I trained all the layers without freezing any layers and the result can be seen in the figure \ref{fig:cnn-vgg19-roc-auc}. The AUC is varying between 0.43 to 0.57 same as the CNN model discussed above. However, if we look at the predicted samples in figure \ref{fig:cnn-vgg19-samples} the prediction probabilities are fairly high for all the diseases. More than 80 percent in most cases. This tells us that this model is overly optimistic and calling every X-ray as a disease with high probabilities. This essentially means this model has \textit{High Recall and Low Precision}.

    \section{Results}
    \subsection{Model Evaluation and Validation}
    The figure \ref{fig:cnn-roc-auc} ROC - auc metric shows the values for the disease labels ranging from 0.43 to 0.57. It means this CNN model is able to atleast make predictions with some certainty, positive or negative or both. Higher value of AUC means the disease can be predicted with more confidence or higher probabilities. Also, as can be seen from the ROC, for some of the disease vectors the AUC is 0.5 and ROC is a linear line, same as that of the benchmark model, which means the model won't be able to perform predictions any better than the benchmark model i.e. random guess.

    \begin{figure}
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./images/chestr-cnn_roc_auc.jpg}
        \caption{CNN ROC AUC}
        \label{fig:cnn-roc-auc}
    \end{figure}

    For validation we can see from the the figure \ref{fig:cnn-samples-predictions} the model has learned some probability values for each of the disease, however these values are fairly low(less than 0.5). This doesn't really tend well for performing predictions on the data for which we do not have the diagnosis. It will be hard to predict exactly which disease is affecting these X-rays.

        \caption{CNN Sample images for disease predictions}
        \label{fig:cnn-samples-predictions}
    \end{figure}

    However, starting from the benchmark model, this is fairly positive direction towards predicting the disease labels. In any case this model performs a bit better than the benchmark on ROC - AUC metrics. 

    The VGG19 trained CNN model shows the following values for Precision and recall, and it can be seen that this is indeed performing "High Recall and low precision" thus the high values for prediction probabilities seen above.

    \subsection{Justification}
    As can be seen from the figures \ref{fig:base-mlp-roc} \ref{fig:cnn-roc-auc} and \ref{fig:cnn-vgg19-roc-auc}, the non-transfer learning CNN model performs much better than our benchmark model. In fact it conservatively predicts the diseases, which though not satisfactory for any real life application is still on the right path to be experimented and improved. 

    \section{Conclusion}

    \subsection{Free-Form Visualization}
    Figure \ref{fig:cnn-samples-predictions} and \ref{fig:cnn-roc-auc} show that the trained model was able to learn the base pattern with very minimal approach. There needs to be fine tuning to increase the metrics for successful predictions. In the sample images it can be seen that CNN is predicting the disease with about 25\%, which is much better than randomly classifying which in best case scenario would be able to predict a disease with 7.69\% certainty(1 in 13 chances to correctly predict the disease). This seems like the correct approach in finding the disease pattern in the x-rays.

    \subsection{Reflection}
    This has been quite a challenging problem, because it was the first time I had to deal with building a trainig model from scratch. The requirement gathering and challenges have been interesting. Quite a lot of research went into building a simple model itself and applications of machine learning in such fields have been eye opening. I would say this project although not a resounding success in implementing a very well predicting model provided enormous learning opportunity with regards to the Deep neural networks and the APIs for developing such networks. Also, most challenging part was also to get the Tensorflow running on the GPU, but worth the effort for saving on training time. 

    \subsection{Improvement}
    The fine tuning of the CNN model with the transfer learning was a failure. There needs to be more analysis done for figuring out why the application of transfer learning did not work. It is possible to seggregate the data and build individual models to predict the disease probability rather than counting and trying to predict these diseases together.

    There is a scope of improvement in training the pretrained models. There are a few existing kernels that can be drawn on for some inspiration to improve the predictions on these models.\cite{cardio-kaggle}

    It would be worth a try to bump up the image size used for training, 128 X 128. If we try to train these models with full size images 1024 X 1024 it is likely that the pattern for diseases can be learnt much better by the model. Usually the disease pattern mass is very small in the images, upon downsampling the image it is likely that we are losing this information thereby unable to train the models well. The main problem with training full size image was the hardware available did not support these values. There needs to be further analysis on how to train full size images which might help in predictions.
